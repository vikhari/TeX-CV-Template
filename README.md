# A TeX Template for CVs/Resumes

The example can be [found here](https://github.com/vikhari/latex-cv-template/blob/master/vikhari-cv-example.pdf).
Be sure to download and view in a PDF viewer to have working hyperlinks (comical easter eggs may be present).

One of the main tweaks from knyte's version is  more standardized approach to the types of sections. These are simply named 1-Tier up to 4-Tier and repsent the number of fields you want to represent in the section (when thought of this way it's easier to plug-and-chug the content into the layout); I recommend putting the more important fields as the first argument (for instance, I leave out location of employer as that seems rather useless with Google these days, and have the first item be the employer name (bolded) and the subfield my position, as most of the time titles vary and the brand name of an employer is more enticing).

A second major change other than simply reorganizing and simplifying the original template is the idea of incorporating different colored href's so that you can categorize or highlight different skillsets (e.g., cybersecurity vs. general IT).
