The example can be [found here](https://github.com/vikhari/latex-cv-template/blob/master/vikhari-cv-example.pdf).
Be sure to download and view in a PDF viewer to have working hyperlinks (some comical easter eggs are in there).

```
A single-column XeTeX resume template with lots of breathing room and a simple
top-down, left-right hierarchy

Installation:

Either clone the latest version of this repository or download and extract an
archive from [releases](https://github.com/knyte/resume/releases).

Usage:

This package provides a class file and a .tex template filled with lipsum. You
can change the content in the template to suit your needs, and/or use the class
definition elsewhere to get similar formatting capabilities.

Dependencies:

To build files using this template, you will need XeTeX and LaTeX2e.

This resume template uses the
[Muli](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Muli?selection.family=Muli) and [PT
Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans?selection.family=PT+Sans)
typefaces, redistributed under the Open Font License. A copy of the Open Font
License (labeled 'OFL.txt') can be found within each typeface's directory in
the /resources/fonts subdirectory.
